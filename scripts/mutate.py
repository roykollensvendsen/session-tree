"""Turn every rule off in turn and see which tests notice.

Green on a first run proves nothing: a test that has never been red tests
nothing. Where a rule is written before its test, the test is run red first.
Where a rule already exists, this is the substitute. Every rule lives in
scripts/mutations.toml, one row each. Run it from the repository root:

    uv run python scripts/mutate.py [--write evidence/tests/rule-mutations.md]

A kill is not enough on its own. A mutation breaks whatever it breaks, and it
can break a test for an incidental reason — a documented example whose output
happened to change — leaving a rule looking guarded when nothing guards it. So
this also checks that the test named after the rule is one of the ones that went
red, and fails the run when it is not. `tests/test_rules_have_evidence.py` is
what requires that test to exist in the first place.

Green on a first run proves nothing: a test that has never been red tests
nothing. Where a rule is written before its test, the test is run red first.

## What this does not prove

That the rules are the right rules, or that a rule catches every case of what
it names. It proves each rule is load-bearing: switch it off and a named test
says so. The last column is why that is worth more than a count: a mutation can
break a test for an incidental reason, and a `NO` there fails this script even
though something went red. A new rule follows the order in `CONTRIBUTING.md`
instead, a failing test first, and is added to `scripts/mutations.toml`, which
`tests/test_rules_have_evidence.py` requires.
